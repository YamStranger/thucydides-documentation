If you are running your acceptance tests against an embedded web server (for example, using Jetty), it can occasionally be useful to access the service layers directly for fixture or infrastructure-related code. For example, you may have a scenario where a user action must, as a side effect, record an audit log in a table in the database. To keep your test focused and simple, you may want to call the service layer directly to check the audit logs, rather than logging on as an administrator and navigating to the audit logs screen.

Spring provides excellent support for integration tests, via the SpringJUnit4ClassRunner test runner. Unfortunately, if you are using Thucydides, this is not an option, as a test cannot have two runners at the same time. Fortunately, however, there is a solution! To inject dependencies using a Spring configuration file, you just need to include the Thucydides SpringIntegration rule in your test class. You instantiate this variable as shown here:


--------------------
@Rule
public SpringIntegration springIntegration = new SpringIntegration();
--------------------

Then you use the +@ContextConfiguration+ annotation to define the configuration file or files to use. The you can inject dependencies as you would with an ordinary Spring integration test, using the usual Spring annotations such as @Autowired or +@Resource+. For example, suppose we are using the following Spring configuration file, called ‘config.xml’:


--------------------
<beans>
    <bean id="widgetService" class="net.thucydides.junit.spring.WidgetService">
        <property name="name"><value>Widgets</value></property>
        <property name="quota"><value>1</value></property>
    </bean>
    <bean id="gizmoService" class="net.thucydides.junit.spring.GizmoService">
        <property name="name"><value>Gizmos</value></property>
        <property name="widgetService"><ref bean="widgetService" /></property>
    </bean>
</beans>
--------------------

We can use this configuration file to inject dependencies as shown here:


--------------------
@RunWith(ThucydidesRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(locations = "/config.xml")
public class WhenInjectingSpringDependencies {

    @Managed
    WebDriver driver;

    @ManagedPages(defaultUrl = "http://www.google.com")
    public Pages pages;

    @Rule
    public SpringIntegration springIntegration = new SpringIntegration();

    @Autowired
    public GizmoService gizmoService;

    @Test
    public void shouldInstanciateGizmoService() {
        assertThat(gizmoService, is(not(nullValue())));
    }

    @Test
    public void shouldInstanciateNestedServices() {
        assertThat(gizmoService.getWidgetService(), is(not(nullValue())));
    }
}
--------------------

Other context-related annotations such as +@DirtiesContext+ will also work as they would in a traditional Spring Integration test. Spring will create a new ApplicationContext for each test, but it will use a single ApplicationContext for all of the methods in your test. If one of your tests modifies an object in the ApplicationContext, you may want to tell Spring so that it can reset the context for the next test. You do this using the +@DirtiesContext+ annotation. In the following test case, for example, the tests will fail without the +@DirtiesContext+ annotation:


--------------------
@RunWith(ThucydidesRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(locations = "/spring/config.xml")
public class WhenWorkingWithDirtyContexts {

    @Managed
    WebDriver driver;

    @ManagedPages(defaultUrl = "http://www.google.com")
    public Pages pages;

    @Rule
    public SpringIntegration springIntegration = new SpringIntegration();

    @Autowired
    public GizmoService gizmoService;

    @Test
    @DirtiesContext
    public void shouldNotBeAffectedByTheOtherTest() {
        assertThat(gizmoService.getName(), is("Gizmos"));
        gizmoService.setName("New Gizmos");
    }

    @Test
    @DirtiesContext
    public void shouldNotBeAffectedByTheOtherTestEither() {
        assertThat(gizmoService.getName(), is("Gizmos"));
        gizmoService.setName("New Gizmos");
    }

}
